Tealet
===================
This is a python module for Python 2.7 providing the tealet switching functionality,
that is, stack slicking in its simplest form.

It is more primitive than the features provided by Greenlets_ and so an emulation
module is also provided, `tealet.greenlet`.  The raw tealet library can be used to
build other higher level apis.
